typescript will not run in browser, therefore we have to compile typescriptto javascript

compiling code will help us find errors, and will allow us to run code on browser.

compiling converts typescript file to js file and notifies us of errors, but completiong will occur even with errors. 

however it will let us know what erros there are so we can fix them in the JS file.
