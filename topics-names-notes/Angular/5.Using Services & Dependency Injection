# what are services?
acts as a central repository, somewhere to store code in
#how to create a services
can be a new folder or just created in app folder
logging.service.ts 
export class LoggingService {
  logStatusChange(status:string) {
    console.log('a server status changed, new status: ' + status);
  } 
}
1. import service 
2. add to constructor ex. constructor(private loggingService: LoggingService){}
3. under @component({
  add providers: [LoggingService] <---angular will recognize this 
})

## services hierarchical injector
app module provides application wide
app component provides for all components but not for other services
any other component with services it provided for that component and all of its children components.
...........only top parent needs providers array filled, still needs rest of information
add @Injectable to recieving place of the service
only add if you expect something to be injected
